								<p>Ladies and gentlemen welcome to my TED Talk on what my group did this past week. My team and I embarked on a journey to create a story generator that would captivate and enthrall young audiences. We set out with a bold goal and a clear destination in mind, but as is often the case in any great adventure, we encountered some obstacles along the way. After our first model didn't work, we shifted gears and decided to try something new. We trained our model on TED Talks, believing that the wisdom and inspiration found in these speeches would be the perfect foundation for our children's stories. In many ways, we were right. The stories that emerged were definitely more aligned with our goals than before, but as we delved deeper, we discovered that they were still not quite what we were looking for. They came out more like rants than the kind of stories that would capture a child's imagination. Despite our apparent shortcomings, progress is not always a straight line. It's a winding path with twists and turns, and this week, we made progress. We took a step in the right direction. We learned something new and we're closer to our goal than we were before. To all of you out there who are working towards a goal, don't be discouraged by setbacks. Embrace them as opportunities to learn and grow. And remember, progress is not a destination, it's a journey. And we will continue to press on in pursuit of our goal, to create a story generator that will capture the hearts and minds of young audiences everywhere.</p>
