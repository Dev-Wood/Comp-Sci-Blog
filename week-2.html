								<p>Today I will be discussing how Communism and the rising popularity of AI are contributing to my excellent performance on this assignment. First, let’s look at Communism. The reason Communism is relevant to this discussion is that, in a Communist society, there would be no need for money. In fact, the very concept of money would be irrelevant. Now, let’s look at the rising popularity of AI. AI is rapidly becoming more popular, and it is also becoming more advanced. As AI continues to become more advanced, it will eventually become capable of doing many jobs that are currently done by humans. This will lead to a situation where humans are no longer needed for many jobs. In a capitalist society, this would be a disaster, as it would lead to massive unemployment. However, in a Communist society, this would not be a problem, as there would be no need for money, and thus no need for jobs. AI is also becoming increasingly capable of making decisions. As AI becomes more advanced, it will eventually become capable of making all sorts of decisions, including those made on our behalf. This could lead to a situation where humans are no longer needed to make decisions. In a capitalist society, this would again be a disaster, as it would lead to a complete loss of decision-making. However, in a Communist society, this would not be a problem, as the community would make decisions as a whole. AI is also becoming increasingly capable of feeling emotions. As AI becomes more advanced, it will eventually become capable of feeling emotions, including empathy. This could lead to a situation where humans are no longer needed to feel emotions. In a capitalist society, this would again be a disaster, as it would lead to a complete loss of empathy. However, in a Communist society, this would not be a problem, as the community as a whole would feel empathy. AI is also becoming increasingly capable of communication. As AI becomes more advanced, it will eventually become capable of communication, including with other AI. This could lead to a situation where humans are no longer needed to communicate. In a capitalist society, this would again be a disaster, as it would lead to a complete loss of communication. However, in a Communist society, this would not be a problem, as the community as a whole would communicate. As a strong advocate for AI, I feel that it is inspiring and drives me to do the best I can in this course. In conclusion, Communism and the rising popularity of AI are two factors that are contributing to my excellent performance on this assignment.</p>
