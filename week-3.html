								<p>The pin to an anchor assignment has been one of my favourite projects so far. I enjoyed getting to come up with a unique business where I can sell cool things. Designing a unique website to fit the theme was a fun challenge too. First Ahamed and I prototyped in Figma where we planned out the general webflow, and design of all our pages. This week we designed the login page, adin login page, the actual storefront UI, and the landing page. The largest issue I had though, was the fact that sometimes figma would snap a shape to be 1px off of where it had snapped the last one, so I had to manualy edit the position of shapes. I had never done anything this in depth with figma before so that was fun. It was a great way to get my ideas out without having to interrupt the design process with more technical time spent coding.</p>
